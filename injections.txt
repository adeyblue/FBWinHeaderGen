#
# This file can be used to place plain text in an output file
# It's not used for anything right now, but you can still make use of it
# The format is very imilar to the fixes file
#
# Namespaces are specified with one dash
#
#- windows.win32.foundation
#
# Then the section of the file is specified by two dashes
# This can be
# functions
# functionptrs
# interfaces
# Enums
# constants
# structs
#
# An example is this
#- windows.win32.foundation
# -- structs
# Type GUID
#    a as ULong
#    b as UShort
#    c as UShort
#    d(0 to 7) as UByte
# End Type
#
# Type IID as GUID
# Type CLSID as GUID
#
# The 'section' is a remnant of when the file output was done each type of thing at a time (and failed)
# right now with the freebasic output they're just all output at the bottom of the file after all the stuff in the namespace
